# PISA-Data-Story-Telling-Student-math-behavior-and-score

## Step One - Choose a Data Set
PISA Data:
PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education.
Around 510,000 students in 65 economies took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, mathematics and science representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally. 
The data and topics of investigation come from the PISA Data Visualization Competition. 


## Step Two- Design the project
The variable of the dataset has 636 variables. I only included the subset of 8 studentsâ€™ math behavior("talkAboutMaths","helpFriendsMaths","extracurricularActivity","participateInCompeti
tions","studyMoreThan2ExtraHoursADay","playChess","computerProgramming","participateIn MathClub") for analysis.

## Step Three- Create Visualization
Built a story on Tableau to convey my findings.

## Step Four- Feedback
I share my project and get 3 feedback to improve my visualization.
